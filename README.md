# Write Until You Die

A unique writing exercise application that challenges you to keep writing without stopping. If you pause for more than 5 seconds, your text gradually blurs and eventually disappears - forcing you to maintain a continuous flow of creativity.

## Features

- **5-Second Challenge**: Text blurs if you stop typing for more than 5 seconds
- **Progressive Blur**: The longer you pause, the more blurred your text becomes
- **Word Counter**: Real-time word count displayed as you type
- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design to keep you focused on writing
- **No Distractions**: Simple UI that promotes writing flow

## How It Works

1. Start typing in the text area
2. Keep writing without pausing for more than 5 seconds
3. If you pause, watch as your text slowly blurs
4. Resume typing to clear the blur and continue
5. Stop too long and your text disappears completely!
